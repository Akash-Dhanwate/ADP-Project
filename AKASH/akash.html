                    <p>Peter Parker was a normal teenager living in New York City. He went to school, hung out with friends, and tried to live a normal life. But one day, something unbelievable happened — the sky opened, and a bright, glowing portal appeared above the city.Through this portal, Peter discovered a secret he never knew: his world was just one of many. There were countless other worlds — some full of heroes, some full of danger — all connected in what was called the Multiverse.</p>

                    <p>When Peter got close to the portal, its energy mixed with his spider powers. Suddenly, his webs were no longer ordinary. They could stretch across worlds, trap enemies in new ways, and even create tiny portals to other dimensions.Peter soon realized the Multiverse was in danger. Some worlds were collapsing, and dark forces from other dimensions wanted to take control of everything. If nothing was done, chaos could spread across all realities.</p>

                    <p>Determined to protect not only his own world but countless others, Peter became the Guardian of the Web. He trained harder, used his new multiverse powers, and learned how to travel safely between worlds using his webs.</p>

Every swing, every web, every decision mattered — because he wasn’t just saving one world anymore, he was saving many.</p>
