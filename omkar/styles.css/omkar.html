        <h2>The Rise of the Stormbreaker ⚡</h2>
        <p>
            In an alternate realm of Midgard, Thor awakens after centuries of slumber, only to find the Nine Realms consumed by darkness. The All-Father’s power lies dormant, and chaos rules the skies. With Mjolnir shattered, Thor must forge a new weapon — the Stormbreaker
            — to restore balance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside warriors of the future, he faces the Shadow Titans and the Void Serpent, creatures born from forgotten stars. Each battle awakens the storm within him, making him stronger than ever. In the final clash, Thor channels the eternal lightning, merging
            his soul with the storm — becoming not just the God of Thunder, but the Storm itself.
